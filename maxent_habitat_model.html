    <h1>MaxEnt Habitat Model</h1>
    <p>This project developed a habitat suitability model for the Northern Goshawk (Accipiter gentilis) 
      in the Tsetspa7 Forest Licence area, British Columbia, to support conservation efforts through advanced 
      geospatial analysis. The study integrated Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR), Vegetation Resource Inventory 
      (VRI), and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) with Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) modelling to identify critical 
      habitat characteristics and predict high-suitability areas.
    </p>

    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>The Northern Goshawk (<i>Accipiter gentilis</i>) relies on mature and old-growth forests for nesting and foraging, 
      making it vulnerable to habitat loss from logging and forest management practices. This project employed MaxEnt 
      habitat suitability modeling to map critical habitat features in the Tsetspa7 Forest Licence area. By leveraging 
      advanced geospatial techniques and GIS, the study produced detailed suitability maps to inform conservation and 
      sustainable forest management.
    </p>

    <h2>Study Area</h2>
    <p>The study area is the Tsetspa7 Forest Licence, located within the Sea to Sky Forest District. The project site 
      is north of Harrison Lake, extending east of Golden Ears Provincial Park and southeast of Lillooet Lake, in the 
      lower Lillooet River valley. Access to the area is via Duffey Lake Road (Highway 99) and the Lillooet River Forest 
      Service Road (FSR). Figure 1 shows the geographic extent of the licence area.

    <h2>Data Processing</h2>
    <p>Environmental variables for the Northern Goshawk habitat suitability model were derived from LiDAR and VRI data. 
      LiDAR data were processed to create two DEMs and DSMs, generating Canopy Height Models (CHMs) via the "LAS Dataset 
      to Raster" and "Calculate Raster" tools. These were merged, reprojected to NAD 1983 UTM Zone 10N, and clipped to the 
      project boundary. VRI data provided classification variables: Forest Type (Coniferous, Deciduous, Unknown), Crown 
      Closure (Low, Medium, High), Stand Age (Young, Mature, Old Growth), and BEC Zone (High or Low Suitability). All 
      variables were rasterized to 5m resolution for consistency.

    <h2>MaxEnt Modelling</h2>
    <p>Three MaxEnt models were developed in RStudio and documented in markdown notebooks. Model 1 (tsetspa7_model) used 12 
      occurrence points, Model 2 (tsetspa7_synthetic_model) expanded to 212 points (200 synthetic). Model 3 (tsetspa7_model_v2) 
      used 23 occurrence points and incorporated the full extent of available LiDAR data across the project area. All models 
      balanced fit and predictive power, with regularization minimizing overfitting while preserving ecologically relevant 
      patterns.

      )

    <h3>Model Performance</h3>
    <p>MaxEnt models were validated using a 70/30 train-test split, LOOCV, and K-Fold CV:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Model 1</strong> (12 points): LOOCV AUC = <strong>0.9182</strong>; limited by small dataset.</li>
      <li><strong>Model 2</strong> (212 points): LOOCV AUC = <strong>0.9567</strong>, K-Fold AUC = <strong>0.9500</strong>; excellent generalization.</li>
      <li><strong>Model 3</strong> (23 points): LOOCV AUC = <strong>0.8268</strong>, K-Fold AUC = <strong>0.8275</strong>; does not rely on synthetic data.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Habitat Suitability Maps</h2>
    <p>The habitat suitability maps showed distinct spatial patterns for Northern Goshawk habitat across the Tsetspa7 Forest 
      Licence area. Model 1, based on 12 points, predicted 38.58% high-suitability habitat but was influenced by limited data. 
      Model 2, using 212 points (including synthetic data), produced a more balanced distribution with 18.44% high suitability. 
      Model 3, using 23 original points and full LiDAR coverage, was the most conservative, identifying only 15.68% as high 
      suitability but offering the most detailed spatial representation. Across models, suitability strongly aligned with BEC 
      zone (CWH/MH), coniferous forest type, and mature/old-growth stands. The final map from Model 3 provides the 
      most accurate delineation of potential habitat.

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>This project successfully developed habitat suitability models for the Northern Goshawk in the Tsetspa7 Forest Licence area through the integration 
      of LiDAR, VRI, and MaxEnt modeling techniques. Among the three models developed, Model 3 emerged as the preferred approach despite its lower AUC (0.8275) 
      compared to Models 1 and 2. Its preference stems from its utilization of comprehensive LiDAR coverage across the entire project area and its reliance on 
      a larger set of original occurrence points (23), providing the most spatially complete and biologically relevant habitat characterization. The resulting 
      suitability maps classify 15.68% of the study area as high suitability, 28.95% as medium suitability, and 55.37% as low suitability, offering a conservative 
      but precise delineation of potential Northern Goshawk habitat. The methodology developed and insights gained aim to contribute to the long-term conservation 
      of the Northern Goshawk in British Columbia, demonstrating the value of integrated geospatial analysis in species conservation efforts.
